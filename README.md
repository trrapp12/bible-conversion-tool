### DESCRIPTION:

<br/>

> 26. Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
> 27. Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
> 28. And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:
>
> --Jesus Christ, Matthew 6: 26-27

<br/>

_This assignment called for a conversion tool, but instead of imperial to metric I wanted to answer something a little more fun. Have you ever wondered how many centimeters were in a cubit?_
